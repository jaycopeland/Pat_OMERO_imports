Dear Jay,

 First, I would like to thank you again for helping to send me the data in harddrive last week.  I am working on these for the paper resubmission and things are going well.

Liz and I are working together to prepare the website for the FoxO3a paper.  To do this, Liz asked that I work with you to upload the raw tif files onto OMERO server for public sharing.  You may have already got notified about a google doc file that I created that list out all of the data required for the public sharing (Please see the link again below).

For some of the dataset, we decided to omit some of the processed data.  We may or may not omit these wells when uploading to OMERO, depending on what Peter wants. In the google doc file, I list out where each folder are in the ImStor/data/NIC/Pat.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you very much for your helps.

Pat
